# Bouncing Balls

[Live Demo](https://lewisjfoster.github.io/bouncing-balls/)

Bouncing Balls is a React based application that simulates the behaviour of a bouncy ball.
When the user clicks on the screen a ball will appear and bounce until it comes to a stop at the bottom of the screen. (The ball may bounce out off the screen). The application can handle multiple balls at the same time, each with a random speed.
